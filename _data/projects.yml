  description: Looking at the market for hinge draw-latches there are no products on the market that I could find that fits the requirements of the project JFM-Proj-001.3 Filament Dry-box. The project requires a hinge for the lid of the box that also acts like a draw latch or tension latch in operation to create an air tight seal.<br>With this is mind, the aforementioned project JFM-P001 Filament Dry-box needs a custom hinged draw-latch as there are none available on the market that meets the needs of the project. It needs to be inexpensive, preferably less than $5 per pair, of an under-center style so that the handle covers the mechanism creating a clean and simple appearance, and have a take-up of at least 10mm. It shall be surface mounted using M3 screws and the overall dimensions should not succeed 20mm in width or 40mm in length with a projection not exceeding 13mm. Ideally it will be identical to JFM-Proj-002 for consistency.

  description: Looking at the market for draw-latches and tension-latches there are lots of options, however, the majority of what is available are metal over-center latches that have take-ups way larger than required, overall dimensions and projections that far exceed the constraints of the project JFM-P001 Filament Dry-box, and being over-center are not appealing to the eye with the complex mechanism exposed. Lastly, the cost of these latches on the market are over $10 individually or per pair, putting them outside the price range of the JFM-P001 project.<br>With this is mind, the aforementioned project JFM-P001 Filament Dry-box needs a custom draw-latch as there is no draw-latch available on the market that meets the needs of the project.
