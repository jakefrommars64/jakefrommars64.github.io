description: These labels are just a small expansion to other labels by Pred and Eistee (if 48,000 labels is considered a small expansion!). They are compatible with the Gridfinity bins by Pred. I plan on adding more varieties and sizes, as well as even more in the future and will update this model page as I do so.
